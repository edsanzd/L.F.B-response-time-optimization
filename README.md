# LFB Response Time Optimization

## 📘 Project Overview
This Data Science project analyzes and estimates emergency response times for the London Fire Brigade (LFB), the UK's busiest fire and rescue service. Using incident and mobilization data from 2009 onward, the project explores patterns, builds predictive models, and identifies contextual factors (e.g., traffic, weather) that influence response delays.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore and visualize historical response data
- Estimate response and mobilization times using ML/DL
- Identify key factors affecting delays
- Propose data-driven strategies for operational improvement

## 🧠 Techniques
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost
- Deep Learning: Neural Networks
- Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R²
- Interpretability: SHAP values

- [LFB Mobilisation Records](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-mobilisation-records)
- Supplementary datasets: traffic, weather, population density

## 📈 Reports
- Report 1: Data exploration and preprocessing
- Report 2: Modeling and algorithm comparison
- Final Report: Integrated analysis, conclusions, and recommendations

## ❤️ Impact
By understanding and optimizing emergency response times, this project aims to support life-saving decisions and improve public safety through data science.
